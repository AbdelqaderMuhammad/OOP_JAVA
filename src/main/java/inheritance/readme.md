## inheritance.

# single inheritance.
---------------------
subclasses inherit the features of one superclass.

# Multilevel inheritance.
------------------------
a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class


# Hierarchical Inheritance
---------------------------
one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass.


# Multiple Inheritance through Interface.
-----------------------
Multiple inheritances, one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.
Please note that Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes.



# Hybrid Inheritance through Interface.
---------------------
is a mixture between the above types and it will be throughout the interfaces.


# What can be done in the sub classes.
---------------------------------------
The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
We can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
We can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it (as in the example above, toString() method is overridden).
We can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
We can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
We can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.
